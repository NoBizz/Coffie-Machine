<h2 align = "left">Motives</h2>
<p align="left">
As an ejoyer of coffie having a slow coffie machine is a pain, not only that,it does not even connect to my home network,
  so I also have to click a button and wait for my coffie, now that takes time, and time is not something I like wasting.

  The idea is to save some time, specificaly in between taking a shower and pressing the button to make coffie,
  however coffie machines of these types cost more than I am willing to spend, so if you don't buy, then DIY
  ,I made one myself.

<p align="left">
Coffie machines are more complicated than expected, utilizing some embeded programming and circuit design a new machine was made from scratch.

<h2 align = "left">Conclusion</h2>
<p align="left">
The project is a great exercise of embeded system knoweladge along with circuit design, requireing a compleate new design  pronciples as the hardware must support all software needs and future firmware requirements.
